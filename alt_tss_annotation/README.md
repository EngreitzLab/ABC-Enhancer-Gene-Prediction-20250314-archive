Scripts used to generate celltype specific TSS 

Look into sbatch.getGenomeTSS.sh to see how to run this pipeline on the sherlock slurm cluster :

example command: 
bash sbatch.getGenomeTSS.sh ENCODE_final_celltype.tsv 

Look into log.sh to see how to generate 
- example_data contains the original gene annotation file, you could ideally switch this for something else of your choosing 
- example_output contains the final celltype specific Gene TSS file that can be used as input into ABC as well as the corresponding intermediate files generated by getGenomeTSS.py

What the scripts do: 

1. Takes in DHS/H3K27ac and generates counts at all promoter regions 
2. We calculate a value termed as Promoter Activity : sqrt(DHS_counts*H3K27ac_counts)
3. Across all promoter regions identified for each gene, rank promoter regions by Promoter Activity
4. Select top 2 TSS regions for each gene
