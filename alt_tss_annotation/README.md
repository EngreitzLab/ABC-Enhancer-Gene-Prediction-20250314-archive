Scripts used to generate celltype specific TSS 

Look into log.sh to see how to generate 
- example_data contains the original gene annotation file, you could ideally switch this for something else of your choosing 
- example_output contains the final celltype specific Gene TSS file that can be used as input into ABC as well as the corresponding intermediate files generated by getGenomeTSS.py
