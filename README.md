# Activity by Contact Model of Enhancer-Gene Specificity

The Activity-by-Contact (ABC) model predicts which enhancers regulate which genes on a cell type specific basis. This repository contains the code needed to run the ABC model as well as small sample data files, example commands, and some general tips and suggestions.

If you use the ABC model in published research, please cite:
